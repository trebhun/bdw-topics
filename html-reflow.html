 		 	<p>Reflow is the browser process for re-calculating the positons and geometries for document elements in order to re-render.  Reflow is considered a user-blocking operation, so it is important to improve reflow time.  This can be done by reducing unnecessary DOM depth, because changes at one level in the 'DOM tree' can cause changes all the way to the children in the modified node.  You should also minimize CSS rules and removed unused lines.  As well as move complex redering changes outside of animations, by using position-absolute or position-fixed.</p>

 		 	<p>Reflow can be explained as a process or visualization technique of a browser's page arrangement, and the goal is to limit the time a reflow takes.  It can be explained like this, elements of content are contained in rectangles with dimensions and ordered in a hierarchy.  Roughly each content element's geometric information is considered a formatting object called a frame.  The process of computing the geometric information of these frames for browser engines is reflow.  This is part of the browser's rendering process.</p>
