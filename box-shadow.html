 		 	<p>Box Shadows are the CSS function to display what is often called a drop shadow.  You type this into your code by typing in box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,.28).  This example means that a box-shadow will be applied 2px to the x axis, making it right of the object, and the next 2px applies the shadow 2px down the y axis, so the shadow is going to appear off the bottom right.  An optional 3rd value that isn't included here is the spread, to make a shadow bigger. The 5px is the blur of the shadow, which breaks up the shadow edges.  The rgba describes the 3 colors and the 4th is the opacity.  So here the opacity is made to be 28% </p>

 		 	<p>Box shadows can include a list of shadows, each defined by 2-4 values that describe the horizontal offset, vertical, blur distance and spread distance.  You can also include optional color values and 'inset' keyword for an inner shadow.  This site has good visual references for different types of shadows and blurs applied.  It also illustrates padding box shape and other effects.  You can even layer multiple shadows, to add multiple colors or depth perception/</p>
