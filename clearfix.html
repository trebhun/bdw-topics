 		 	<p>Sometimes there will be a floated element that you want to prevent from hangin down into another section and appearing next to it.  When it happens it is called a float collapse, and you can use clear in your css styling to fix this.  For example, you can tell all the H2 headings in a section to never appear next to a floated item through saying H2 clear:both.  This means that the heading will now clear or avoide any floated items from both side.  If you only want to separate the headings from items floated to the right, then you would say clear:right.</p>

 		 	<p>.clearfix:after is a css solution to put in the styling section that will clear floats and make sure you don't have float collapse.  This property can have details like visiblity: hidden, display: block, font-size, content, clear, or height.  This method allows you to clear floats without hiding overflow and setting a width or floating other things to get the job done.</p>
