 		 	<p>Special characters and accented letters require a special set of code in order to appear correctly on the html pages.  These are character entities, which you insert into your HTML code so that the browser will interpret these and show the corresponding symbols or characters you want.  Examples of entities that require these codes, are apostrophes or double quotes for example</p>
