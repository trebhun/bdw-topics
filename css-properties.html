 		 	<p>CSS properties are an element within the syntax of CSS phrases.  This means that CSS rule has two main parts, the first being a selector and the second being one or more declarations that follow.  The selector tends to be the HTML element you are tyling, and the declaration is a property and corresponding value.  The CSS property is the style attribute that you apply changes to, and every property has a value.  Visually this can look like this, h1 {color:blue; font-size:12px;}.  In this example, h1 is the selector, color and font-size are properties, blue and 12px are the values.  CSS properties are a fundamental part of all CSS styling.
