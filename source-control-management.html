 		 		Source control management is also known as revision control or version control, and is the way to organize and control revisions with a timestamp.  These revisions can be restored or sometimes merged, and can work from more than one developer can be managed.  When working on projects, it is good practice to submit code into the source control repository, as this can be considered a measure of project progress.  Value comes from submitting your code to the respository so that others can use your version, merge it with theirs or deploy it.  When you commit early and often, it gives you the option to rollback to recent code and not lose much progress.  Since it is easy to commit changes, it is crucial to remember to inspect them to insure that quality is committed.  Additionally, include messages to describe why the code is committed to better navigate through the varied code.

SCM provides the ability for developers to work side by side on the same project, with the option to converge code, or not.  SCM is a major component in creating better code, and therefor better development results.
