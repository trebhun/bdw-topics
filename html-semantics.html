		<h2> What are html semantics? </h2>
			<p> Html semantics are the use of html to enforce the webpage's information and meaning, and they are elements that describe the meaning to both the browser and the developer.</p>
		<h2> Why are html semantics important? </h2>
			<p> Html semantics are meant to separate presentation and content, as a way to maintain orgranization and clarity for webpages.  They are elements suchas form, table, or img that clearly define its content.  In contrast, non-semantic elements would tell us nothing about their content, like div or span. Good semantics mean that a html document outline is well organzied and can be easily viewed by a blind reader.  This means that the semantics help to make the information accesible and when it is marked up properly the structure of a document is clear.</p>
