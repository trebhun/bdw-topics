 		 	<p>Box Shadows are the CSS function to display what is often called a drop shadow.  You type this into your code by typing in box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,.28).  This example means that a box-shadow will be applied 2px to the x axis, making it right of the object, and the next 2px applies the shadow 2px down the y axis, so the shadow is going to appear off the bottom right.  An optional 3rd value that isn't included here is the spread, to make a shadow bigger. The 5px is the blur of the shadow, which breaks up the shadow edges.  The rgba describes the 3 colors and the 4th is the opacity.  So here the opacity is made to be 28% </p>
