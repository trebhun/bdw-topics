		<h4> What and Why </h4>
			<p> The document outline is a map of the document, using important structural elements that create a table of contents for understanding what is in the document. The HTML5 document outline is meant to help with organization when creating a document, and can help you keep a clear structure for the purpose of easier search engine results, or easier understanding for a blind page viewer. </p>

		<h1> HTML5 Features </h1>
	<section>
			<h4> - Asides </h4>
					<p> HTML5 allows the document outline to contain asides, or special sections that are not necessarily related to the particular document. This is new from HTML4.  These are relevant but don't need to be seen in the larger document outline.  These may still be related to the larger site, but can be sections suchas an advertisement block or explanation boxes. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4> - Nesting </h4>
		<p> So all content inside the body element is part of a section, and HTML5 allows these sections to be nested.  A nested section is meant to logically separate parts of a section for semantic purposes, not for stylizing purposes. </p>
	</section>
	<section>
			<h4> - Outline Headings </h4>
 		 			<p> Sectioning in the HTML is what defines the structure of the document outline.  The headings hanked h1 to h6 define the heading 'rank' of the current section. An important point to notice here is that the relative rank is what matters in a section, not the heading rank number of the sections.  So section structure determines the outline, and each section appears in the outline, with its own hierarchy within each section. For example, an outline with 2 sections and a subsection can look like this: </p>
 			<section>
 				<h2> h2 Heading </h2>
 			<section>
 				<h3> h3 Subheading </h3>
 			</section>
 			</section>
 			<section>
 				<h5> h5 Heading </h5>
 					<p> This h5 heading might be smaller than the 2 above, but is still a main heading in the document outline!</p>
 					</section>
